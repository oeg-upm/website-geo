	"about_data_p1": "Open Data is a philosophy and practice that seeks to make certain data freely available around the world, without restrictions on copyright, patents or other control mechanisms. The data should be published unprocessed, well structured and in familiar formats that facilitate re-use.",
	"about_data_p2": "The public sector produces a wide variety of interesting information for citizens and businesses, such as social, economic, geographical, statistical, meteorological or tourism information, business and education information. This information has characteristics that make it particularly attractive for the digital content sector, as it is complete, reliable and of high quality.",
	"about_data_p3": "The opening of public sector data allows any person or organization to build on them a new idea that results in new data, knowledge, improve processes, add value to existing ones or even create new services. Therefore, it has considerable economic potential and also favours transparency, participation and citizen collaboration, which is necessary for a more open government.",

	"about_web_p1": "In recent years, the use of data visualization tools and applications focused on geospatial data, such as meteorology, navigation systems, computer graphics or even augmented reality videogames, has increased. Users and developers have been inhibited by the lack of software diversity, the different formats that exist, the knowledge required and the lack of understanding of the data offered or needed to develop these interfaces. These are the main reasons why modifying, combining and even simply downloading geospatial data can be a very difficult or almost impossible task in most cases.",
	"about_web_p2": "The aim of this project is to solve all these needs and problems free of charge and without profit motive, for all types of users. This objective has been established on the premise that any type of user should be able to take advantage of the validity, richness and possibilities offered by open data, in this particular case, geospatial data. So... anyone can search, upload (in the not too distant future), view, combine, download and ultimately have an experience according to their profile according to the use they make of the data mentioned.",
	"about_web_p3": "The portal is, in this sense, a gateway to the creation of a community of users that will be created over time and share open data licensed for viewing and use, in addition to its subsequent healing and updating.
